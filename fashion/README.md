# SELF-REPLICATING FASHION MADE OF TRASH!

1. FIND CLOTHES YOU LIKE AND WANT TO COPY
2. FIND TEXTILE WASTE
3. CLONE PATTERNS FROM CLOTHES TO TEXTILE WASTE
4. MODIFY, AMPLIFY, MAKE IT TRASH MAGIC
5. WEAR, SPREAD THE MEME, REPLICATE
6. WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO MAKE AN IMPACT, START CRASHING FASHION EVENTS TO INJECT OUR MEMES INTO THEIR WORLD
